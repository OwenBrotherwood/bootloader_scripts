Bluz DK Hardware Files
==========
Bluz is a Development Kit (DK) that implements the Wiring language and talks to the [Particle](https://www.particle.io/) cloud through Bluetooth Low Energy. It can be accessed through a REST API and programmed from a Web IDE.

These scripts are used to upload firmware and keys to bluz through the bootloader setup mode.
